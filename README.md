# Various Sandbox programs

I personally use the term *Sandbox* when associated to a computer project as a project where anything goes, a safe project where I can learn and create whatever so I feel to learn about various subjects within a specific language, framework, etc...  In the past, I had a similar environment set-up when I have a huge *Django* developer where I'd try out new and interesting concepts which may or may not make it into a full program.  This repository here in GitHub is just that, a repo where I can place various sandbox projects to aid others in learning alongside with me.  Enjoy!
